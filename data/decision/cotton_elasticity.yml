  notes: |
    Elasticities based on historical cotton price relationships (2015-2026).
    India monsoon lag of 1 period reflects typical impact on next season's market.
    Synthetic elasticity reflects substitution dynamics.
    Supply shocks (disease, extreme weather) modeled as disruption variable.
